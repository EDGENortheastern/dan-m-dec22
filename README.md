The Currency Converter App is an application that allows the user to convert any amount of currency to another currency of their choice. The input field cannot be left blank or have 0 as the amount, the value of 1 will be filled automatically in the input field. This app uses exchange rates that are updated on a daily basis via an API, so the conversion calculations are accruate. Below are some key features I aim to display.
* User can input any number to convert
* User can select any two countries currencies to convert to and from
* User can switch the conversion by selecting the arrow inbetween the to and from box
* A clickable button that displays the conversion amount

# Environment
